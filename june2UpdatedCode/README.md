First change the matlab folder to the one containing the entire code. The videos can be anywhere in the system,but you should have them all together and know the complete path. And most important point is the naming ofbthe training vids. These MUST be red.avi or green.avi or orange.avi because the code assumes this. The mixed-beads vid canbbe of any name.

Now type mainCounter in the command window. This starts the main code. Choose 2 for classification. Type in how many beads are in the mixture of beads. For example,type 2 for a red-green mixture.

Eenter the path of training vid (any one,no particular order needed)  in single quotes. Next you will be asked for the vid name. As mentionrled earlier this shiuld be one of thr three allowed names. Again, in single quotes. Follow same procedure as for ciunting.

Repeat for next video. Repeat for mixed beads video. You can say 'n' if you dont want to see plots. Write everything in single quotes.
Number of frames of all trainjng vids shuld be large enough to get enough trainjng data. Choose 300 or so frames  to start with. - May 22, 2012
